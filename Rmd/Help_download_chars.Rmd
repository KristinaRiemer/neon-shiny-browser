One big advantage of the NEON Shiny Browser is that all data products come stacked: what this means is that all data is unzipped, joined, and grouped by relevant characteristics before it ever reaches your computer. This is the difference, shown on the download of <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.00003.001' target='_blank'>Triple aspirated air temperature</a> at the Santa Rita Experimental Range.

On the left side (or top) is data that isn't stacked; there is one zip file for each year-month of the data, and one of the files has been unzipped in the picture to show what the resulting folder would look like. On the right side (or bottom) is data already stacked; the different CSVs of each year-month have been joined together, resulting in only three data files total.

Stacking occurs for every data product that can be stacked. Except for <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP4.00200.001' target='_blank'>eddy covariance</a> (<a href='https://www.hdfgroup.org/' target='_blank'>HDF5</a>) and AOP data, everything is stacked. AOP data has its own structure, which is preserved in their downloads.
