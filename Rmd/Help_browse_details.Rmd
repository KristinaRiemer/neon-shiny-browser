After you find an interesting data product, whether it is through browsing by site or product, the next step is viewing the important details. These details include:
* The description of the product
* The abstract/importance of the ecological characteristic described by the product
* The design of how the product is captured
* NEON's notes about the product
* The sites that have the product, if not already selected

This information is all shown in the `View Details` tab. Information is all based off the Product ID assigned to each product, in the form of "DP#.#####.001": To view these details, type in (or preferably, copy and paste) the ID of a product into the corresponding text box. One useful shortcut to this occurs in the `Find Product` step. By clicking on a cell in the table in that step, the Product ID is automatically filled out, and the corresponding information appears. This is what it looks like:

There are a few things to note. At the top, there are obviously the ID, name, and description of the product, and a `Toggle Download` checkbox, which will be addressed right after this. After that, pressing `View more info` will bring up more details about the product, producing the screen to the right. This extra information includes the product abstract, product design, and any notes, and also provides the option to download the full characteristics of the product.

The `Toggle Download` checkbox is the easiest way to move onto downloading a product. Clicking `Download` will bring you to the next download step, with the appropriate type of download selected (`Regular` for basic, non-AOP downloads, `AOP` for AOP).
