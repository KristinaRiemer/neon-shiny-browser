The map contains layers, which are categories of the important NEON elements. Navigating through these layers are very important for finding all the information associated with NEON locations, and they can be toggled on and off through the legend at the upper right corner of the map.

There are 4 layers:
* Field Sites: These are the <a href='https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites' target='_blank'>81 Field Sites</a> where NEON research and measurements take place, denoted by the <img src='https://github.com/cyverse-gis/NEON-Shiny-Browser/blob/master/Img/NEON.png?raw=true' height='25'> icon. You can click on the icon to view more about its information, and the blue-green line around it represents the boundary for that field site (if an explicit border exists).
* Domains: The blue outlines represent domains, the 20 ecoclimactic regions that NEON's sites are organized around. Each represents "distinct regions of vegetation, landforms and ecosystem dynamics". Click on a domain to view it.
* Flight Boxes: These red outlines are the regions where <a href='https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing' target='_blank'>AOP observations</a> are collected. In other words, these are the boxes where NEON flies aircrafts, collecting high-resolution remote sensing data. Currently, there are only the 2016 and 2017 boxes, so not having a red box on a field site doesn't mean that there are no AOP products available for that site.
* Sub Locations: Every field site contains many sub locations, such as plots and grids for terrestrial sites, and wells, stations, and gauges for aquatic ones. Each sub location will appear as a small logo within the boundaries of a field site, and they are updated every few months. To avoid overloading the app, the locations don't appear upon the app's opening; they must be added by site, and the next steps of this guide will show how.
