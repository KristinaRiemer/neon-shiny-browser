Here are a few last tips to make using the map easier.
* On the map itself, make sure to check out the upper left and right corners.
* In the upper right corner is the spot to change map tiles and toggle map layers.
* In the upper left corner are some useful tools. In addition to the zoom in/out buttons, there is a full-screen button and a measurement tool. Both can come in handy.
