This method is specifically designed for AOP flight products. A Product ID and Field site are required; once those are provided, a table will appear with all of the available years marked by "âœ…". This table is used to select a year to download, and it is done simply by clicking on a column.

Once a year is chosen, there is the option to estimate the download size. This is recommended, as downloads can be very large. Unlike the size calculator for the General method, the estimations here are fairly accurate.

The downloads will appear in a new folder of the form **AOP\_\<site\>\_\<year\>**, located in the **NEON Downloads** folder. This data comes straight from the <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/data-api' target='_blank'>NEON API</a>, and the download will be **very large and very time consuming**.
